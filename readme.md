This Spring the Data & Visualization Services Department will host a series of campus/community-oriented, informal sessions on the R programming language.  Our goals is to promote a friendly environment for exploring the extensible capabilities of the R software environment specifically supported through R and RStudio.  Beginner's are welcome, experts will be encouraged to share topical expertise.  How has R enabled your work?  What else can R help you accomplish?  Join us most Thursdays at noon in [the Edge](http://library.duke.edu/edge) (Workshop Room -- [map](http://library.duke.edu/edge/spaces)).  Bring your lunch (or not); light refreshments will be provided.
