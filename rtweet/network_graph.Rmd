# Preface

Using the graphTweets package with the rtweet package to generate a network graph.  graphTweet can write a file in "gephi format" -- forwhich Gephi can open and display

```{r}
library(graphTweets)
library(rtweet)
```

## Get Tweets
```{r getTweets}
dukmbb <- search_tweets("dukembb", n=100, lang = "en")
dukmbb <- dukmbb%>% 
  filter(is_retweet == FALSE)
```


## Identify Edges
```{r}
edges <- getEdges(data = dukmbb, tweets = "text", source = "screen_name")
```

## Notes
```{r}
nodes <- getNodes(edges)
```

## prepare plot
```{r}
# plot
g <- igraph::graph.data.frame(edges, directed=TRUE, vertices = nodes)
```

## Plot
```{r}
plot(g)
```


## Dynamic Graph
```{r}
dynamise(data = dukmbb, tweets = "text", source = "screen_name",
                start.stamp = "created_at", write=TRUE)

```

This process wrote the file "graphTweets.graphml" which can then be opened in Gephi
