## Format
Presenters are asked to speak for approximately 30 minutes; think lightning talks.  Leave time for questions and discussion.  Scope should be about R, R packages, RStudio and/or the Tidyverse with respect to Data Science, Data Analytics, Statistical Sciences and/or Big Data.   The following framework is encouraged:  
* Why is this package/tool of interest?  
* How does it work?  /  Is it worth it to learn it?  / What does a workflow look like?  
* Expose attendees to what can be done with [R]  
* How is your topic used in your discipline?
