# R we having fun yet‽  A learning series on [[R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language))].
## Sponsored by Duke University Libraries, [Data & Visualization Services](http://library.duke.edu/data)
This Spring the Data & Visualization Services Department will host a series of campus/community-oriented, informal sessions on the R programming language.  Our goals is to promote a friendly environment for exploring the extensible capabilities of the R software environment specifically supported through R and RStudio.  Beginner's are welcome, experts will be encourage to share topical expertise.  How has R enabled your work?  What else can R help you accomplish?  Join us most Thursdays at noon in [the Edge](http://library.duke.edu/edge) (Murthy Digital Studio -- [map](http://library.duke.edu/edge/spaces)).

## Format
Presenters are asked to speak for approximately 30 minutes; think lighting talks.  Leave time for questions and discussion.  Scope should be about R, R packages, RStudio and/or the Tidyverse with respect to Data Science, Data Analytics, Statistical Sciences and/or Big Data.   The following framework is encouraged:  
* Why is this package/tool of interest?  
* How does it work?  /  Is it worth it to learn it?  / What does a workflow look like?  
* Expose attendees to what can be done with [R]  
* How is your topic used in your discipline?
